# Human Activity Recognition (HAR) Using Smartphones

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project predicts human activities (Walking, Sitting, Standing, etc.) from smartphone accelerometer and gyroscope data using machine learning. Multiple algorithms are implemented and compared to find the most accurate approach.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Build a predictive HAR model from smartphone sensor data.
- Compare performances of multiple ML/DL algorithms.
- Explore applications in health monitoring and activity tracking.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- **Source:** Smartphone accelerometer & gyroscope readings.
- **Features:** 561 extracted from raw signals.
- **Labels:** Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, Sitting, Standing, Laying.
- **Files:** `train.csv`, `test.csv`
